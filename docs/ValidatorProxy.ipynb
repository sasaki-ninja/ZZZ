    "# How can the Zeus Subnet be used to query miners on live data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to make it as easy as possible to build a product around this subnet. By default, a validator will automatically start a Proxy process, which allows it to query miners using data of the validator's choice! This is all seamlessly integrated with the main validator logic, meaning a miner will not know whether an incoming request concerns one they will be scored on, or one that is used for a downstream product.\n",

    "This notebook will briefly demonstrate how to use the Proxy API. Note that it is very simple to modify it for your own use-case, which can be done by modifying $\\texttt{zeus->api->proxy.py}$.\n",
